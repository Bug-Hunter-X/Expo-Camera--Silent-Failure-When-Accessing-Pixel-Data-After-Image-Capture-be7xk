# Expo Camera Image Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API in conjunction with `expo-image-manipulator`.  The issue involves a silent failure during image manipulation after capturing an image with the camera.  The error lacks sufficient detail, making it difficult to debug.

## Problem Description

After capturing an image using Expo Camera, attempting to access and manipulate the image's pixel data using `ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync` results in a silent failure. The returned object lacks the expected image data, and the provided error message isn't informative enough to pinpoint the cause.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on a physical device or emulator.
3. Take a picture using the Expo Camera.
4. Observe the console output; the image manipulation will fail silently, without a meaningful error message.

## Solution

The provided solution involves adding error handling, asynchronous operations, and verification steps to the image capture and manipulation flow.  This improvement helps to identify and resolve the root cause of the problem.
